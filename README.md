# ArrayExpress
temporary repo for ArrayExpress debugging

As far as I can tell, as of 2021-01-27 there is no endorsed github repo for ArrayExpress, but
some bugs have been reported.

I am taking a snapshot of the sources for communal investigation here.  There is nothing
official about this codeset and ultimately the code will need to be fixed in git.bioconductor.org
